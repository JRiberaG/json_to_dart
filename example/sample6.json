  "description": "Fr. Mike talks about how we see both an abundance of faith, and a great lack of faith in our readings today. While the widow Elisha visits shows us a beautiful example of walking in faith, king Ahaz fails to repent as he falls deeper into sin. Today's readings are 2 Kings 4, 2 Chronicles 28, and Psalm 127.\nFor the complete reading plan, visit ascensionpress.com/bibleinayear.\nPlease note: The Bible contains adult themes that may not be suitable for children - parental discretion is advised.",
